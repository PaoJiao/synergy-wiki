<blockquote>
<nowiki>
Thanks for the pull request! Buildbot is now [building](http://buildbot.synergy-project.org/builders) your pull request (it usually takes about 30 minutes). When done, the packages will be automatically uploaded (http://synergy-project.org/nightly?filter=pr-octocat-foobar-fix). Please test and let me know if it worked.
</nowiki>

# Attempt to reproduce the bug before trying the packages
