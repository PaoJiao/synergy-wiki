= Running Synergy on OSX via plist =
These instructions <del>shamelessly</del> borrow the "answer" to a similar topic [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9522324/running-python-in-background-on-os-x here]. 

This page, on the other hand, is about the topic '''[please briefly explain the topic here]'''.  

Here we create a shell script and a property list file (plist), and activate the plist using the launchctl command-line tool.

The shell script runs the synergyc Unix executable, telling it to connect to a laboratory workstation.  The property list file '''[please briefly explain what the plist file does here]'''.  

== Make a Shell Script ==
First make a little bash script or whatever to contain your synergy calls..

For example, I put mine in <code>~/.scripts/synergyscript.sh</code>

Here's what my script looks like:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

## Synergy client, connecting to Lab workstation
/Applications/Synergy.app/Contents/MacOS/synergyc -f -d FATAL -n Intrepid 192.168.1.102
</pre>

Here I'm telling the synergy client I'm running to announce my machine's name is ''Intrepid'' and I'm getting to to connect to the ip ''192.168.1.102''.

I used this format so that I might later add additional separate instances of synergy, as this was on a laptop that moves around.

Then make sure you make your script executable: <pre>chmod +x ~/.scripts/synergyscript.sh</pre>

''does it need to be made executable?  we don't need that to run it manually.  Does launchctl or the plist require it?''

Run the script manually to confirm it works: <pre>~/.scripts/synergyscript.sh</pre>

If it works, you should see '''[please describe that here]'''.  If it doesn't work, you might see '''[please describe]'''.  In that case, try '''[please describe]'''.  

== Create the corresponding plist file ==
I created my plist file under <tt>~/Library/LaunchAgents/ca.dawning.scripts.osx.synergy.plist</tt>

It contains:
<pre>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd >
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>ca.dawning.scripts.osx.synergy</string>
    <key>Program</key>
    <string>/Users/j/.scripts/synergyscript.sh</string>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
  </dict>
</plist>
</pre>

== Activate your plist with launchctl ==
<pre>
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ca.dawning.scripts.osx.synergy.plist
</pre>

To unload it, just swap that ''load'' above with ''unload''.
