# Guidelines

* Each new release should be described by a milestone.
* Each milestone should take 2 weeks to complete.
* There should be an equal distribution of 'must have', 'should have' and 'nice to have'.
* Issues should be selected from the [next label](https://github.com/synergy/synergy/labels/priority-next).
