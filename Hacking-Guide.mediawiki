Before checking in code, make sure:

# You read the [[Code Style]] guide
# Considered writing [[UnitTesting|unit/integ tests]] for new code
# That the '''existing''' unit/integ tests all pass
# You've fully tested your fix (and any other feature it might affect)
# Changes to cross-platform code compiles on all platforms (Windows, Mac and Linux)

After checking in:

# Update any issues you fixed or features added
# Consider requesting a code review on the dev mailing list
