==Supported operating systems==

===Fully Supported===

* Windows XP SP3 through latest non-beta Windows
* Ubuntu 14.04
* Mac OS X 10.9 through the latest non-beta version
* RedHat 6 and above
* Fedora 19-21

===Partly Supported===

We're not actively testing on these platforms, so our software may not work properly but may also work without issues.

* Windows 2003 Server
* openSUSE
* Fedora
* Ubuntu 13.10 and below, or 14.10 and above
* Fedora 22

===Unsupported===

We are no longer supporting these platforms due to lack of support for new features.

* Mac OS 10.8 Mountain Lion and below
* Windows NT/2000
* Windows 95/98/ME
* Linux systems running OpenSSL < 1.0.1 (for encryption support)

==Network requirements==

* Systems using Synergy must be on the same local network.
* The network can be wired or wireless.

==Other requirements==

* The Synergy system acting as the "server" must have a keyboard and mouse (or pointing device).
* The "client" systems can have keyboards/mice, but those are not necessary once the clients are configured and Synergy is running. It will be necessary to control them without Synergy (either locally or via a remote login) until Synergy is up and running on the server and client.
* Synergy is a KBM application (KeyBoard and Mouse), not KVM (Keyboard, Video, and Mouse) so in [[Use as a KVM|most circumstances]] each system must have a monitor.
