==Supported operating systems==

===Fully Supported===

# Windows XP SP3 through latest non-beta version
# Ubuntu 14.04
# Mac OS 10.6 through the latest non-beta version

===Partly Supported===

We're not actively testing on these platforms, so our software may not work properly but may also work without issues.

# Windows 2003 Server
# openSUSE
# Fedora
# Ubuntu 13.10 and below, or 14.10 and above
# RedHat 6

===Unsupported===

We are no longer supporting these platforms due to lack of support for new features.

# Mac OS 10.5 Leopard and below
# Windows NT/2000
# Windows 95/98/ME

==Network requirements==

# Systems using Synergy must be on the same local network.
# The network can be wired or wireless.

==Other requirements==

# The Synergy system acting as the "server" must have a keyboard and mouse (or pointing device).
# The "client" systems can have keyboards/mice, but none are necessary once they are configured and Synergy is running. It will be necessary to control them without Synergy (either locally or via a remote login) until Synergy is up and running on the server and client.
# Synergy is a KBM application (KeyBoard and Mouse), not KVM (Keyboard, Video, and Mouse) so in most circumstances each system must have a monitor.
