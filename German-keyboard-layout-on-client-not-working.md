German Server -> Windows 10 -> German keyboard layout
German Client -> Manjaro Linux -> German keyboard layout

If the client swaps z and y, and can't write german letters correctly (öäüß) type "setxkbmap de" in terminal.

Now it works correctly.

You might want to put that in some autostart for it to work automatically.
