Sometimes, for various reasons, the GUI doesn't work or is not ideal for starting up Synergy. In those cases, you can run it from the command line. This can be encapsulated in a batch file or shell script for easy access.

=General Info=
The Synergy binaries generally take the same parameters on all 3 platforms.

See [[Textual Config]] for information on how to create a config file. If you have another system on which you can use the GUI, you might consider setting up your system in that GUI, and then exporting the config file with File -> Save Configuration As and copy it over to the system you need it on. The same config file will work on any platform.

=Windows=
===Client===
Open up a command prompt and cd into the Synergy install directory. Something like:

cd "c:\program files\synergy"

Then run the Synergy client binary, pointing it at the Synergy Server. Something like:

synergyc [server IP]

===Server===
Again from the Synergy install directory:

synergys -c [path to config file]


=Mac=
===Client===
Open up a Terminal and cd into the Synergy install directory. Something like:

cd /Applications/Synergy.app/Contents/MacOS

Then run the Synergy client binary, pointing it at the Synergy Server. Something like:

===Server===
Again from the Synergy install directory:

./synergys -c [path to config file]

Open up a Terminal and cd into the Synergy install directory. Something like:

./synergys -c [path to config file]
