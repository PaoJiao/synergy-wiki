==How to make Synergy run automatically at startup==

===Windows===

The official way is to use the Windows service feature in 1.4 which works with Windows Vista/7. This is now the default behavior upon installation. To have Synergy ''not'' start on boot, you need to edit the properties of the service and set it to Manual.

===Mac===

You can use a [[Startup/Mac OSX plist Instructions | plist through launchd]]. There's also an example of this method in the source code.

You can use [[Startup/Mac OSX LoginItems Instructions | Login Items in the Accounts control panel]]. 1.4.12 w/ encryption - 8/21/13 [[User:Kitz | Kitz]]

===Linux===

Start synergy client (synergyc) on Fedora 22 using LightDM

Apply all command as root, from a command line TTY (text console or remote SSH)

Install LightDM <pre>
dnf install lightdm
systemctl stop gdm
systemctl disable gdm
killall -u gdm
systemctl enable lightdm
systemctl start lightdm
</pre>

Create a start/stop script
<pre>vi /etc/lightdm/syneryc-start.sh</pre><pre>
#!/bin/sh
# script to start/stop synergyc
killall synergyc
case $0 in *stop*) exit 0 ;; esac  # exit now if called 'stop'
synergyc -n `hostname -s` -d INFO YOUR_SYNERGYS_SERVER_HOSTNAME
exit 0
</pre>
Link as a stop script
<pre>ln -s syneryc-start.sh /etc/lightdm/syneryc-stop.sh</pre>
Tell lightdm to call scripts
<pre>vi /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/synergy.conf</pre><pre>
[SeatDefaults]
greeter-setup-script=/etc/lightdm/syneryc-start.sh
session-setup-script=/etc/lightdm/syneryc-stop.sh</pre>

Remove that last line if the user does not want to start his own synergyc daemon.

Originates from Bug #1755   -- This GDM method no longer works in Fedora 22 :-(

Howto start synergy client (synergyc) at boot on FC11 (Fedora Core 11)

This is not really a bug report - but just some hints how to successfuly install synergyc so that it start at boot in Fedora Core 11. 
Please integrate this in the main help.

<pre>
/etc/gdm/Init/Default:
# This script needs to start synergyc as user root - this synergyc runs on the
# login screen. IMPORTANT: I've found that at boot time NAME LOOKUP does not
# YET work so you MUST use the server's IP ADDRESS otherwise synergyc will
# fail to connect and exit after a few seconds (--reconnect does not work):
# so the BUG REPORT/enhancement request would be to make --reconnect work so
# that it never/ever exits synergyc - even if name lookup does not work, or
# if there is no display, etc.. As a (bad) alternative you can also use: 
# (sleep 10; /usr/bin/synergyc YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME) &
# NOTE: I've also found that sometimes you need to kill synergyc with -9
/usr/bin/killall -9 synergyc 
sleep 1 
/usr/bin/synergyc YOUR_SERVER_IP

/etc/gdm/PostLogin/Default:
# this script needs to kill the root synergyc started by Init/Default
/usr/bin/killall synergyc 
sleep 1 

/etc/gdm/Xsession:
# this script will start the user synergyc - the one that runs after you have logged in 
# Note: here you can also use your server's hostname, instead of the IP
/usr/bin/killall synergyc # no need, I guess?
sleep 1 
/usr/bin/synergyc YOUR_SERVER_IP
</pre>

I took a different approach - wrote a script to start/stop synergyc. 

I changed my scripts as follows:

<pre>
# end of file, before exit 0
/etc/gdm/Init/Default:# SYNERGY BEGIN
/etc/gdm/Init/Default:# start synergy as root user (login screen)
/etc/gdm/Init/Default:/usr/local/bin/synergyc-ctl.sh start
/etc/gdm/Init/Default:# SYNERGY END

# top of file, after comments
# For at least CentOS 6.2, this needs to be in /etc/gdm/PreSession/Default
/etc/gdm/PostLogin/Default:# SYNERGY BEGIN
/etc/gdm/PostLogin/Default:# stop root synergy (login screen)
/etc/gdm/PostLogin/Default:/usr/local/bin/synergyc-ctl.sh stop
/etc/gdm/PostLogin/Default:# SYNERGY END

# top of file, after comments
/etc/gdm/Xsession:# SYNERGY BEGIN
/etc/gdm/Xsession:# start synergy as login user
/etc/gdm/Xsession:/usr/local/bin/synergyc-ctl.sh start
/etc/gdm/Xsession:# SYNERGY END
</pre>

Here's also /usr/local/bin/synergyc-ctl.sh:

Here is an [https://gist.github.com/roadst4r/487bb0365d488a9f9ce7 updated version of this script] which includes support for setting crypto, display, logs, screenname.

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
OP=${1}

# put the synergy server IP here (at boot time name lookup does not work
# and synergyc will fail and exit, using the IP prevents the problem)
SERVER_IP=192.168.1.10

SYNERGYC=/usr/bin/synergyc
PS=/bin/ps
GREP=/bin/grep
WC=/usr/bin/wc
PIDOF=/sbin/pidof
SLEEP=/bin/sleep

# check synergyc is running
function sc_check
{
  N=`${PS} -ef | ${GREP} "${SYNERGYC}"  | ${GREP} -v "${GREP}" | ${WC} -l`
  return $N
}

# kill synergyc if running
function sc_kill
{
  SIG=""
  while true
  do
    sc_check
    if [ $? -eq 1 ]
    then
      PIDS=`${PIDOF} "${SYNERGYC}"`
      if [ ${PIDS} != "" ]
      then
        kill ${SIG} ${PIDS}
      fi
    else
      break
    fi

    ${SLEEP} 1
    SIG="-9"
  done
}

# start synergyc
function sc_start
{
  while true
  do
    ${SYNERGYC} "${SERVER_IP}"

    ${SLEEP} 2

    sc_check
    if [ $? -eq 1 ]
    then
      break
    fi
  done
}

case "${OP}" in
  start)
    sc_kill
    sc_start
  ;;
  stop)
    sc_kill
  ;;
  *)
    echo "usage: synergyc-ctl [start|stop]"
    exit 1
  ;;
esac

exit 0
</pre>

You can also simply put the command to start synergy as a daemon in ~/.xinitrc, though this won't give you the fine-grained control of a startup script.

 synergys --daemon --restart --display :0 --address 10.137.10.163
