Rules for raising and triaging issues.

The title is the most important part:

1. Avoid long titles (keep them less than ~40)
2. Don't randomly capitalize words (this happens a lot)
3. Don't use the word 'Synergy' in a bug title, there's no need

Once the title is sanitized, check the body:

3. Use either 'bug' or 'enhancement' label (not both)
3. Bugs must include repro steps (and optionally actual and expected)
4. Enhancements must describe a problem (and optionally, a solution)
