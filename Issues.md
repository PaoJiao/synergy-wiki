Steps for raising and triaging issues:

1. Search for duplicates (close with "Duplicates #n")
2. Sanitize the issue title and body (see below)
3. Use either 'bug' or 'enhancement' label (not both)

Rules for sanitizing issue title:

1. Must be short (keep them less than ~40)
2. Must be unambiguous (describe problem fully)
3. Must begin with a capital letter
3. Must not end with a period character (.)
3. Must not have each word capitalized (e.g. Not Like This)
4. Must not use 'Synergy' (wastes valuable space)

Rules for sanitizing issue body:

5. *Bugs:* Body should include repro steps (and optionally actual and expected)
6. *Bugs:* Body should include Synergy version 
6. *Bugs:* Body should include operating system version
6. *Enhancements:* Body must describe a problem (and optionally, a solution)
