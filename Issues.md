Steps for raising and triaging issues:

1. Search for duplicates (close with "Duplicates #n")
2. Sanitize the issue title and body (see below)
3. Use either 'bug' or 'enhancement' label (not both)

Steps for sanitizing issues:

1. Title should be short (keep them less than ~40)
2. Title should unambiguous (describe problem fully)
3. Title should read like a sentence (begin with capital)
4. Title should not use 'Synergy' in a bug title (there's no need)
5. *Bugs:* Body should include repro steps (and optionally actual and expected)
6. *Bugs:* Body should include Synergy version 
6. *Bugs:* Body should include operating system version
6. *Enhancements:* Body must describe a problem (and optionally, a solution)
