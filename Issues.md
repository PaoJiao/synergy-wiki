A few rules for raising issues:

1. Avoid long titles (keep them less than ~40)
2. Use either 'bug' or 'enhancement' label
3. Bugs must include repro steps (and optionally actual and expected)
4. Enhancements must describe a problem (and optionally, a solution)
5. There is no need to use 'Synergy' in a bug title
6. Please don't randomly capitalize words (this happens a lot)
